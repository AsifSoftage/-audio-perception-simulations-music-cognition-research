- Audio perception simulations involve creating virtual enviornments or systems that mimic the way human perceive and process sound.
## Psycoacoustics Simulation:
- Understand how humans perceive and interpret sound.
## Binaural Audio Simulation:
- Replicate the way humans hear sounds in three dimensional space using both ears.
## Room Acoustics Simulation:
- Study the impact of different room acoustics on sound perception.
# Other
- Coachlear implant Sinulation
- Sound Desing and Production
- Speech and Communication Simulation
- Machine Listening and Audio Analysis.
